When you override a function you don't technically need to write either virtual
or override.

The original base class declaration needs the keyword virtual to mark it as
virtual.

In the derived class the function is virtual by way of having the Â¹same type as
the base class function.

However, an override can help avoid bugs by producing a compilation error when
the intended override isn't technically an override. For instance, the function
type isn't exactly like the base class function. Or that a maintenance of the
base class changes that function's type, e.g. adding a defaulted argument.

If some member function vf is declared as virtual in a class Base, and some
class Derived, which is derived, directly or indirectly, from Base, has a
declaration for member function with the same name parameter type list (but not
the return type) cv-qualifiers ref-qualifiers Then this function in the class
Derived is also virtual
